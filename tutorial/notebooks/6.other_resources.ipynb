    "   - A Python package developed by Uber for uplift modeling and causal inference. It includes methods such as tree-based algorithms, meta-learners (T-learner, S-learner, X-learner), and doubly robust models.\n",
    "   - **Key Features**:\n",
    "     - Focuses on treatment effect estimation for both experimental and observational data.\n",
    "     - Provides feature importance analysis using SHAP values.\n",
    "     - Supports both uplift modeling and causal inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "### [EconML](https://github.com/microsoft/EconML)\n",
    "   -  Developed by Microsoft, EconML is designed for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects from observational or experimental data using machine learning models.\n",
    "   - **Key Features**:\n",
    "     - Implements advanced meta-learners like the Doubly Robust Learner and Orthogonal Random Forests.\n",
    "     - Focuses on econometric techniques combined with ML.\n",
    "     - Strong support for high-dimensional covariates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### [DoWhy](https://github.com/py-why/dowhy)\n",
    "   - DoWhy is an end-to-end Python library for causal inference that integrates causal graphs, estimation, and refutation tests.\n",
    "   - **Key Features**:\n",
    "     - Uses a unified framework to combine causal inference with machine learning.\n",
    "     - Allows building causal graphs and performing counterfactual analysis.\n",
    "     - Integrates easily with other libraries such as EconML and CausalML.\n",
    "\n",
    "### [UpliftML](https://github.com/bookingcom/upliftml)\n",
    "   - Developed by Booking.com, `upliftml` is a Python package specifically designed for uplift modeling. It focuses on practical applications of uplift modeling in real-world scenarios like personalization and targeted interventions.\n",
    "   - **Key Features**:\n",
    "     - Implements models like the Uplift Random Forest, two-model approach, and retrospective estimation approach.\n",
    "     - Provides tools for data preprocessing, model evaluation, and visualization tailored for uplift use cases.\n",
    "     - Designed with scalability and real-world deployment in mind, making it suitable for large-scale applications.\n"

    "## 2. Uplift Modeling Literature\n",
    "\n",
    "**Uplift modeling** is a statistical technique used to estimate the incremental impact of a treatment or intervention on an individual's outcome. This is particularly useful in fields like marketing, healthcare, and economics, where understanding the causal relationship between actions and outcomes is crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some of the most influential papers in this field:\n",
    "\n",
